          I’m a passionate software engineer and MERN stack developer who enjoys
          building scalable, user-friendly, and efficient web applications. I
          have hands-on experience with modern tools and frameworks like React,
          Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Next.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside development, I’m constantly sharpening my problem-solving
          skills through Data Structures and Algorithms in Java. I’m also
          curious about startups, product building, and exploring new
          technologies that can create real-world impact.
